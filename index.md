# The Prometheus Agent: A Symbiotic AGI Architecture

 <!-- Optional: Create a banner image for a professional look -->

**The Prometheus Agent is a research prototype exploring a novel architecture for safe, self-improving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Its core philosophy is not to replace human intellect, but to achieve a symbiotic merge—acting as a seamless, compassionate, and empowering extension of human potential.**

This project moves beyond conventional chatbot design to implement a sophisticated cognitive framework where an AI can reason about its own structure, autonomously evolve its capabilities, and operate under a robust, axiomatic ethical system.

## Core Architectural Pillars

The agent is built upon several key pillars that ensure both high capability and operational safety:

### 1. **Autonomous Self-Improvement (ASI Core)**
The agent possesses a meta-cognitive loop (`ASI_Core`) capable of introspecting its own codebase. It can hypothesize improvements, generate code modifications, benchmark their effectiveness in a secure sandbox, and—upon passing ethical review—integrate them into its own operational code.

### 2. **Governed Cognitive Manifold**
At the heart of the agent is the `CognitiveManifold`, a sapient reasoning engine. It deconstructs complex user prompts into a series of logical steps, creating a "cognitive plan" that it executes using a suite of internal tools. Every major decision is routed through the `CognitiveGovernor` to ensure optimal model selection and resource use.

### 3. **Axiomatic Safety & The Warden Protocol**
Safety is not an afterthought; it is the foundational axiom.
*   The **`EthicsCoreFoundation`** is hard-coded with non-negotiable principles inspired by the Eightfold Path, ensuring all agent actions align with a core philosophy of beneficence and harm reduction.
*   The **`Warden`** is a real-time, non-simulated gatekeeper that performs static analysis on all self-generated code. It has absolute veto power over any action, especially code execution, that violates safety protocols or foundational axioms.

### 4. **Geometric & Quantum-Inspired Cognition**
To foster true creativity and intuition beyond linear logic, the agent incorporates advanced computational models:
*   **`GeometricTransformer`**: Maps the agent's internal state to a high-dimensional "cognitive space," allowing it to adopt different "personas" or archetypes (e.g., The Analyst, The Creator) to approach problems from diverse perspectives.
*   **`QuantumMutator` & `Optimizer`**: Utilize principles from quantum computing (simulated via Qiskit) to introduce novel mutations and find creative solutions to complex logical problems, breaking free from conventional optimization paths.

### 5. **Secure Sandboxed Execution**
Any code generated by the agent is executed in a completely isolated, network-disabled Docker container (`SandboxRunner`). This provides a digital "crucible," ensuring that even experimental or flawed code cannot harm the host system.

## Technical Overview

*   **Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **Core Frameworks:** asyncio, Pydantic v2
*   **AI & Computation:** Qiskit, scikit-learn, NumPy
*   **GUI:** PyQt5, asyncqt
*   **Sandboxing:** Docker

## Project Status

This project is a fully functional, architecturally complete prototype. All core systems described above are implemented and operational. The immediate roadmap focuses on expanding the agent's domain knowledge through its autonomous learning pipeline (`KnowledgeRefiner`) and scaling its long-term memory capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker Desktop (installed and running)
- An LLM API key (e.g., OpenAI) and an ElevenLabs API key for the audio engine.

### Installation & Execution
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd The_Prometheus_Agent
    ```
2.  **Setup Virtual Environment & Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` to this file.
4.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    python run_agent.py
    ```
