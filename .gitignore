# Prometheus Agent - Definitive .gitignore
# ==============================================================================
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
# A clean .gitignore is a sign of a professional, well-managed project.
# It ensures the repository contains ONLY source code, not generated artifacts,
# secrets, or local environment files.
